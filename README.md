# cnn_project
Experimented with diffrent cnn arhitectures to the effects on a popular dataset about the multiclass classification of diffrent animals based on their heads. The effects of transfer learning can easly be seen.
Inserting new layers to early layers vs ending layers of transfer model are also obsereved and compared.
# Note that
Training these models can take a considerable time even with a high-end computer. So the models should run separately.
